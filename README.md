This is the supplementary code for the paper "Apollo 16 Revisited: Surface-Wave Analysis of Reconstructed Active Seismic Experiment Data using Compressed Sensing and Frequency-Time Analysis". 

There are two example notebooks, one shows the power of Compressed Sensing to reconstruct sparse data. The other details how the Apollo 16 waveforms were reconstructed in the paper.
