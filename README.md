This is the supplementary code for the paper "Apollo 16 Revisited: Compressed Sensing Reconstruction of Active Seismic Experiment Data for Surface Wave Analysis". 

There are two example Jupyter notebooks, one shows the power of Compressed Sensing to reconstruct sparse data. The other details how the Apollo 16 waveforms were reconstructed in the paper.

Make sure you have the requirements installed as noted in the requirements.txt file.
